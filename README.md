# 💡 ML Healthcare & Cyber Security Project

This is my **B.Tech Major Project (2024–25)** combining the power of **Machine Learning** with real-world **Healthcare** and **Cybersecurity** applications. The project focuses on detecting attacks and anomalies in sensitive healthcare data using classification techniques, presented through an interactive web application.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. 🔽 **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Meghashyam-adimallam/ML_HealthCare_CyberSecurity_Project.git
   cd ML_HealthCare_CyberSecurity_Project
📦 Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧳 Unzip the model file:

bash
Copy
Edit
unzip model.zip
🚀 Start the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
🔍 Open your browser at:
http://localhost:5000

📁 Dataset Sources
Custom attack datasets simulated for academic purposes — including:

Brute Force

DDoS (UDP/TCP)

SQL Injection

OS/Port Scan

Normal traffic

📌 Notes
model.sav was over 100MB and is excluded from the repo (GitHub limit).

The model is included as a .zip and can be extracted before use.
